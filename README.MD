# Project for Front-end dev course 
## _(@Wantsome IT Academy)_


**Notices:**
 - Work in progress (mostly at night time hours)
 - Used only one breakpoint, at 768px (to simplify the demo)
 - Estimated day to finish: 15.07.2022

# Todo's:
- ~~navigation with 2 menu hamburgers~~
- ~~a page where we can initialize or reset the database (local storage)~~
- light/dark theme
- font increase/decrease
- use IndexedDB instead of LocalStorage (need some time to learn)
- add some extra back-end juice (PHP + MySql)
- host it on an personal domain to test it "in production"

# To solve:
- add an listener on window resize in order to reset the javascript toggle function (display: none for some menus). Cause: on mobile view, the user click on one of two menus; but not click to go initial state and resize the window; then something ugly happens :(
Importance: low, as users on mobiles (<768px) doesn't resize the window :)
- will see ...
