    "Desc": "The PRS Special Semi-Hollow in Black Gold Burst is an exceptional instrument from the incredible luthiers at PRS. Semi-hollow instruments give a very distinctive sound that guitarists of many genres love. The large cavity in the mahogany body increases resonance and provides this model with a more hollow tone which perfectly compliments the clarity of the mahogany neck. All of this is amplified by the 58/15 LT pair which retains all the clarity with a deep low end and extended high end. If you require more diverse switching options, then reach for the push/pull tone pot to unleash the coil split or try the PRS Narrowfield for even more tonal options.",
